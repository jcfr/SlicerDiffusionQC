# TODO:
1. (DONE) Sylvain told to use red color for fail row, yellow color for unsure row

2. (DONE) The labels should be made colored and bigger

3. (DONE) If mask does not exist, we have to create that

4. (DONE) The controls buttons have to be properly grouped

5. (DONE) Speed up using named-tuple inside [gradient_process](https://github.com/pnlbwh/SlicerDiffusionQC/blob/tashrif-built/cli-modules/diffusionQC/qclib/gradient_process.py) instead of class being used now. Now, it takes 4s for gradient_process which is same as that of raw version.

6. (DONE) Sylvain told to write data as out.csv instead of .txt as of now 

7. (DONE) Show progress bar during gradient_process (takes 52s) and saveResults (takes 36s). Durations are on Tashrif's workstation.

8. Isaiah noted a changed TBD in [diffusionQC.xml](https://github.com/pnlbwh/SlicerDiffusionQC/blob/speed-up/cli-modules/diffusionQC/diffusionQC.xml)

9. Isaiah wants to put some GUI tests [here](https://github.com/pnlbwh/SlicerDiffusionQC/blob/speed-up/GradQC/Testing/Python/CMakeLists.txt)

10. Minor BUG in SlicerUserInteraction.py, Ln 239: every time selectionChanged(), gradientUpdate() is called twice
